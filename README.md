**Hola, I’m @XRG2014**
- **I _LOOOOOOOOOOVE_ CATS**
- I’m interested in coding/shell scripting _(Or really anything tech related)_
- I'll probably just be posting random stuff that I coded, and whatever I code will probably be for either Linux or Windows _(probably windows 10)_
- I'm working with these people:
@NebulaticOfficial
@gitventurer

_(sorry if I spelled your names wrong)_
